# DSA Sheets - LeetCode Problems

## Overview
This repository contains curated Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem sheets sourced from LeetCode. The purpose of these sheets is to help programmers systematically practice and improve their problem-solving skills, focusing on critical concepts and techniques used in competitive programming and technical interviews.

## Features
- **Categorized Problems**: Problems are grouped by topics such as arrays, linked lists, dynamic programming, etc.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Problems are sorted into three levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
- **Tracking Progress**: Keep track of your progress by marking completed problems.
- **Solutions**: Detailed explanations and solutions for each problem (where applicable).

## Problem Categories
1. **Arrays**
2. **Strings**
3. **Linked Lists**
4. **Stacks and Queues**
5. **Trees and Graphs**
6. **Dynamic Programming**
7. **Recursion and Backtracking**
8. **Sorting and Searching**
9. **Greedy Algorithms**
10. **Mathematical Problems**
